/**
 * `undo` tool (spec §32–§36, PH-PROTO-001..003, PH-CONTEXT-005).
 *
 * Reverts the last successful hybrid transaction on one file (all sub-edits
 * together). Precondition: the file's current checksum must exactly match
 * the previous transaction's result — otherwise E_UNDO_STALE and nothing is
 * modified, so undo never overwrites later work. Restores exact previous
 * bytes (BOM, CRLF/CR/LF, final newline, trailing whitespace) and exact
 * previous anchors: anchors present before the transaction return exactly;
 * anchors introduced by the undone transaction become retired.
 *
 * Undo history and file identity are independent of the context epoch
 * (PH-CONTEXT-005): undo works regardless of epoch advances.
