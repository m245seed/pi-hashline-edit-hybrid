/**
 * Startup crash recovery (spec §31).
 *
 * For every unfinished transaction, compare the file's actual checksum:
 *
 * - file == before checksum: the file commit never happened → discard the
 *   pending post-state; keep the before snapshot (it is already stored).
 * - file == after checksum: the file commit happened but DB finalization did
 *   not → promote the stored after-state and create/finalize the undo entry.
 * - file matches neither: an external modification occurred → never guess;
 *   invalidate served state, reconcile anchors from the actual file on next
 *   read, drop transaction-specific undo, and log a divergence warning.
