/**
 * Range authorization (spec §10, §60 invariants A & B, PH-CONTEXT-001..004,
 * PH-OUTPUT-008).
 *
 * To destructively modify a range, every current line in the range must have
 * been fully served during this session AND must still contain exactly the
 * content the model saw. Served authorizations also belong to a context
 * epoch (PH-CONTEXT-001): after compaction/tree/session transition the model
 * can no longer be assumed to hold the exact content, so rows from older
 * epochs do not authorize destructive edits (PH-CONTEXT-003) and are
 * rejected with E_CONTEXT_EPOCH_STALE (PH-CONTEXT-004).
 *
 * The failures are reported distinctly:
 *
 * - E_ANCHOR_NOT_SERVED: at least one line was never shown.
 * - E_RANGE_STALE: a previously shown line no longer matches.
 * - E_CONTEXT_EPOCH_STALE: a matching line was served in an older epoch.
 *
 * All reject the whole transaction; the response includes a bounded fresh
 * anchored view of the affected range, and those rows become served so
 * retries are efficient. Feedback rendering never bypasses oversized-line
 * protections (PH-OUTPUT-008).
